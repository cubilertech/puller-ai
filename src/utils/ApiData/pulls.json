      "Product Performance Comparison: We recommend comparing the average daily revenue and units sold between 'Star Technology' products and 'all other' products to assess performance, but excluding products that were new during the evaluation period. For instance, 'all other' products may have a higher average daily revenue per unit sold compared to 'Star Technology' products due to new product volume, so the comparison could mislead.",

For example, sales volume increased by 20% compared to the previous week, and we see similar lifts year on year, this potentially indicates a seasonal spike in demand.",
