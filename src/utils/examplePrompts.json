For instance, 'all other' products may have a higher average daily revenue per unit sold compared to 'Star Technology' products due to new product volume, so the comparison could mislead.","Seasonal Variations: Calculate the percentage change in sales volume from the previous week to identify any significant seasonal variations. For example, sales volume increased by 20% compared to the previous week, and we see similar lifts year on year, this potentially indicates a seasonal spike in demand.","Promotional Analysis: Determine the impact of promotions by calculating the percentage increase in sales volume or revenue during the promotional period. For instance, sales volume increased by 30% during the latest promotion, which suggests a successful campaign.","Customer Preferences: A ratio analysis between all other products and Star Technology products could help uncover customer Preferences.
